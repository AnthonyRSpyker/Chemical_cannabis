# Chemical_cannabis

  Chemical Cannabis is an interactive web-site that lists all chemicals found in the cannabis plant.  The site currently is just a list of each chemical.  In the future the site will provide a line angle picture and ball and stick structure of each chemical (2-d and 3-d), an IUPAC name, as well as some information describing its nature and known physiological effects.  Further pages that are a part of this address will have interactive games and informative tutorials relating to the production of these chemicals via bio-molecular pathways.
